## Overview
Homer's Odyssey, one of the earliest epic poems still in existence, continues to captivate readers with its timeless themes of heroism, adventure and the complexities of the human experience. Homer's portrayal of female characters should reflect societal norms and cultural values during the Odyssey. However, as the epic is translated into English time and time again over the centuries, questions arise regarding the presence of gender bias and its impact on the depictions of these women. In 2018, Emily Wilson published the first female translation of the Odyssey in English, prompting acclaim and criticism due to her modern interpretation of the text. Despite literary reviews characterizing Wilson's translation as feminist, Wilson asserts her adherence to the original Greek, particularly in terms of vocabulary. Therefore, exploring whether her translation differs from others in portraying female characters is essential. 

This research project seeks to examine gender bias of female character descriptions within English translations of the Odyssey, examining if sociolinguistics affects how different translators interpret and portray female characters. To do so, I will examine how vocabulary in English translations of the Odyssey has shifted throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, terminology usage in contemporary female translations of classical texts, and how other translations compare to Wilson's. Central to this research is Emily Wilson's translation, which challenges traditional interpretations and offers a fresh perspective on the epic. This research uses text analysis to determine whether English renditions of the Odyssey authentically adhere to the original Homeric Greek, how each translator navigated issues of gender representation, and how these choices shaped readers' perceptions of female characters within the text. This project will compare Wilson's rendition with those of other translators, such as Robert Fitzgerald, Richmond Lattimore, Robert Fagles, and Stanley Lombard, to uncover patterns of gender bias and linguistic choice across a range of translations. The corpus comprises translations from the 1900s to the 2010s, each reflecting the translator's unique linguistic style, cultural background, and interpretive lens. Through text analysis using tools such as Voyant, patterns will emerge of gender bias and linguistic choice employed by translators in their portrayal of female characters. 

To ensure fairness in these translators, I will keep a log of the word or phrase in Homeric Greek, my interpretation, and the authors' translations. By examining specific terminology relating to women, such as names, epithets, and descriptors, this project will show how gender bias manifests within the translated text. These findings will all be visualized using Voyants Tools, where text and linguistic analysis will discern patterns in terminology usage. This research will also be supported by scholarship surrounding English interpretations of the Odyssey, gender bias within translations of classical Greek literature, and how socio-historical contexts have shaped gender representation within translations. Beyond textual analysis, this project also explores the socio-cultural implications of translation within Classics. White male scholars historically dominated the discipline. However, the discipline has seen a shift with the emergence of female translators in the 21st century, marking a significant change in the interpretation of classical texts.

Currently, research is focused on analyzing the language used to refer to female characters, both named and unnamed, in the Odyssey, including figures such as Penelope, Nausicaa, and Circe, as well as their servants. Scholarly sources related to the terminology used for female characters in the Odyssey will be gathered to support these findings. While there are existing studies comparing translations of the Odyssey, few have specifically addressed the language used about female characters. Visualizations such as line graphs, word trees, and bubblelines will be used to aid this analysis. As an example, the line and stacked bar graph below illustrate the usage of the term "slave" in Wilson's translation, which she chose over "servant" or "handmaiden" to reflect the language of the period.

Ultimately, this text analysis project aims to contribute to ongoing scholarly discussions surrounding female depictions within translations of the Odyssey, sociolinguistic studies, and the enduring interest of classical literature in the modern world. By critically examining descriptions of female characters in English translations of the Odyssey, this project will illustrate the interplay between translation choices, gender bias, and cultural context. Through text analysis, this project will deepen our understanding of gender representation within the Odyssey, whether it is authentic and equitable, and its enduring significance for readers across generations.
